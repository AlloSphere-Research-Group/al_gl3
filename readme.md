[ ] support for std::vector & std::aray in the places for al::Buffer & al::Array

[ ] use matrix stack (cpu side) for al::Graphics

[ ] al_Config.h >> could this now be replaced with std headers? (pstdint.h)and 

[ ] texture needs some rewrite (GL_TEXTURE0 related)

* mark fuctions that needs to be commented out temporarily with:
`/* !LATER! */`

* al_Memory -> smart pointer?
